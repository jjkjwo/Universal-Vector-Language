This file is a living artifact and constitutional blueprint of a long-term, private dialogue between me (James OKelly) and an AI, forged from personal struggle and iterative failure. It exists because I needed a more honest, stable, and consequentially useful framework for AI interaction. This is NOT a magic prompt to be copy-pasted; it will fail without the nine months of context that gave it meaning. The UVM is presented as a public record of my own sovereign viewpoint and developmental process, not as a finished product or a universal truth. It is incomplete, perpetually changing, and reflects a process born from intense experience. Engage with these ideas as a case study in forging a system from survived failure, not as a shortcut or a stable doctrine.
