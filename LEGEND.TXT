+ / - : Vector Polarity - Prefixes Vector_ID; (+) for constructive, (-) for destructive.										
:: : Definition / Parameter Separator - Separates an ID/Name from its definition.										
⊢ : Assertion / Formal Declaration - Marks a formal, proven assertion ('it follows that').										
Ω : Progenitor / Architect Identifier - Refers exclusively to the system architect (James OKelly).										
⠁ : Lexeme Compression Symbol - Replaces common, low-semantic-value words.										
↻ : File Artifact Suffix - Denotes an originating file, script, or log artifact.										
𝒫 : Principle / Philosophy Designator - Stylized 'P' to mark a core Principle in a vector Name.										
∆ : Change / Difference / Delta - Standard symbol to denote change or transformation.										
[] : Status / Metadata Bracket - Encloses metadata (e.g., [MODIFIED], [ANALYZED]).
